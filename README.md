# Courses Database
A simple database of courses, where users can create, read, update, and delete courses. The application is designed to showcase skills in creating a functional and user-friendly web application using PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS.

## Features
* Create: Users can create new courses by filling out a form with relevant information.
* Read: Users can view all courses in the database on the homepage or search for specific courses using the search feature.
* Update: Users can edit the details of existing courses by clicking on the edit button next to the course.
* Delete: Users can delete courses by clicking on the delete button next to the course.
* Search: Users can search for courses based on the course title or description.

Only logged-in users can create, update, and delete courses. The application also includes a home page (index.php) that introduces what the project is about and displays real content for at least 15 courses from the assignment program.

The visual layout and usability of the application are designed with user experience in mind. The forms are aligned and styled, and the output is nicely styled with each course having a unique containing element that visually sets it apart using borders, bullets, etc. The typography is also styled to be readable and well-padded.
